# Pull request instructions

CDO Pull Requests for ontology repositories generally follow one of two forms: "Bug-fix" pull requests, and all others.

A "Bug-fix" pull request will typically be of low-to-zero risk to the ontology and its downstream resources.  This is different from a bug-reporting Issue.  Bugs described in an Issue can be significantly complex and require committee consensus to resolve.  A "Bug-fix" pull request will generally be close to a self-explaining correction.

The risk assessment of a "Bug-fix" proposal is confirmed by two members of the Ontology Committee leadership agreeing that no committee review is required.

It is difficult to describe what "Low risk" would be in general.  Typo corrections in documentation comments would be likely to qualify.  Correction (not addition) of type constraints are less likely, but still probable.  Cardinality corrections are improbable, as programming assumptions may have been made based on those specifications.  In summary, please be aware that what is submitted as a "Bug-fix" proposal may be treated as requiring committee review, and possibly further use case description.
