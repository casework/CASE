# Bug description

<!--
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

If you are seeing an errant behavior or implementation related to a property, it helps with diagnosing the issue if you can identify the property, for instance by a line within the corresponding ontology Turtle file, the property short name, or some other means.
-->


## Steps to reproduce

<!--
Steps to reproduce the behavior.

If you came across this error by seeing a SHACL validation result, please provide a Turtle or JSON-LD snippet that recreates the error.  Also, please note if you were testing against the current release (master branch) or a development pre-release (e.g. via downloading `CASE-develop.ttl`).  If you don't know, it's likely you encountered this via the current release.
